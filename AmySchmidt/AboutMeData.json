I have learned C, Java, and SQL in my courses, along with learning the concepts of Algorithms, Relational Database Management Systems, Object Oriented Programming, and Operating Systems. In Winter 2013-14 I contributed PHP, HTML, and CSS code to a startup in Chicago called Waitbot. For my 2014 summer internship I worked with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As of August 2014, I began learning Swift in the University of Missouri's Team Based Mobile Application Development Course. At my current position as a developer for the Microsoft Application Development Lab, I have been a main contributor to a Ruby on Rails web application for loaning out devices on campus.", "icon" : ""},
